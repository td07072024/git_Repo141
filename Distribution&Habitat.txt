The American black duck is endemic to eastern North America.[14] In Canada, the range extends from northeastern Saskatchewan to Newfoundland and Labrador.[7] In the United States, it is found in northern Illinois, Michigan, New Jersey, Ohio, Connecticut, Vermont, South Dakota, central West Virginia, Maine and on the Atlantic coast to North Carolina.[7][15]

The American black duck is a habitat generalist as it is associated with tidal marshes and present throughout the year in salt marshes from the Gulf of Maine to coastal Virginia.[16] It usually prefers freshwater and coastal wetlands throughout northeastern America, including brackish marshes, estuaries and edges of backwater ponds and rivers lined by speckled alder.[7][15] It also inhabits beaver ponds, shallow lakes with sedges and reeds, bogs in open boreal and mixed hardwood forests, as well as forested swamps.[15] Populations in Vermont have also been found in glacial kettle ponds surrounded by bog mats.[15] During winter, the American black duck mostly inhabits brackish marshes bordering bays, agricultural marshes, flooded timber, agricultural fields, estuaries and riverine areas.[15] Ducks usually take shelter from hunting and other disturbances by moving to brackish and fresh impoundments on conservation land.[
